# swagger-mock

Runs an HTTP server which mocks all requests specified in a Swagger 2.0 definition.

## Installation

    $ lein uberjar

## Usage

    $ java -jar swagger-mock.jar <swagger-yaml-file>

The server will use the lowest non-default response code of your response definition (mostly 200) and look for the
example in your object schema definition. The server assumes that responses are application/json; if it discovers a
string in the example, it will parse the string as json, else it will take the given data structure as the response.

## Options

You can pass in all variables that the Jetty Ring adapter supports. The most important variable is 'port'
which can be passed as an environment variable:

    $ PORT=9191 java -jar swagger-mock.jar myapp.yaml
