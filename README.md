# swagger-mock

Runs an HTTP server which mocks all requests specified in a Swagger 2.0 definition.

## Installation

The most convenient way to use the swagger-mock is to download the `swagger-mock` script and put it in your $PATH:

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zalando/swagger-mock/master/bin/swagger-mock > $HOME/bin/swagger-mock
    $ chmod +x $HOME/bin/swagger-mock

This way requires Docker to be installed. If you do not have Docker, see the "Build on your own" section.

## Usage

    $ swagger-mock <swagger-yaml-file> [port]

The server will use the lowest non-default response code of your response definition (mostly 200) and look for the
example in your object schema definition. The server assumes that responses are application/json; if it discovers a
string in the example, it will parse the string as json, else it will take the given data structure as the response.

## Build on your own

You need Leiningen 2 installed.

    $ lein uberjar


### Running without Docker

    $ java -jar target/swagger-mock.jar myapp.yaml

You can pass in all variables that the Jetty Ring adapter supports. The most important variable is 'port'
which can be passed as an environment variable:

    $ PORT=9191 java -jar swagger-mock.jar myapp.yaml

## Releasing

    $ lein release
